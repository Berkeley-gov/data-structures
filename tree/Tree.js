/*
Trees are wonderful data structures that can model real life hierarchical information, 
including organizational charts, genealogical trees, computer file systems, HTML elements 
on a web page (also known as the Document Object Model, or DOM), state diagrams, and more.

A tree is composed of tree nodes. A tree node is a very simple data structure that contains:

-- Data
-- A list of children, where each child is itself a tree node

We can add data to and remove data from a tree and traverse it in two different ways:

-- Depth-first, or
-- Breadth-first
